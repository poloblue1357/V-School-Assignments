                Brandon Patterson found a love for writing and reading when he was a child. He has early memories of his mother taking him to the community library weekly to check out new books to read. That love grew, even in high school, when he took an AP Literature class that focused on sharpening the tools of reading and writing. Since the covid-19 pandemic, he has had more time on his hands that used to be spent driving to work. He has put that time to good use, to write his first novel THE CLIENT. His goal was to write a novel that would speak to young adults, and start them on the same path that he found, which was a path of love of reading and literature. To ensure they start down this path, he included elements in THE CLIENT that he enjoyed reading about as a kid. A lot of action, fast cars, a few plot twists, and an endearing ending. Even though his focus is on young adult fiction, Brandon is certain that a vast age range will find this book as intriguing as the next. Brandon plans on turning this novel into a series, all focusing on the main character Brett Simons.

                When he is not writing in the morning and evening, he works as a salesman for a technology company where he resides in Utah. He has been able to harness the sales skill of storytelling in his work to be a basis of writing this novel. When he is not writing or working, Brandon can be seen enjoying the mountainous terrain of Utah with his husky named Blue and his wife Priscila.
